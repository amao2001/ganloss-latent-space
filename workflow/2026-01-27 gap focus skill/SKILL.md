# Gap Focus Storyteller



This skill specializes in crafting prompts that use "visual scarcity" to build narrative tension. By forcing the viewer's gaze through a restricted opening, the subject becomes a "secret" or a "revelation."



## When to use this skill

- Use this when you want to transform a simple subject into a cinematic scene with depth.

- Helpful for themes involving mystery, suspense, elegance, or "hidden" beauty.

- Ideal for genres like Film Noir, Ancient Fantasy, or Cyberpunk street photography.



## How to use it



Follow these step-by-step guidance patterns to construct the prompt:



### 1. The Obstruction (Foreground)

Define what is blocking the view. According to core principles, the foreground must cover **40%–60% of the frame** to create a sense of immersion.

- **Convention**: Always describe the foreground as "heavily blurred" or with "creamy bokeh" to ensure it doesn't distract from the subject.



### 2. The Gap (Visual Channel)

Specify the shape and nature of the opening. 

- **Keywords**: narrow window lattice, cracked door, dense foliage gap, slot between buildings.



### 3. The Narrative Subject (Centerpiece)

Place the subject precisely in the "gap." 

- **Guidance**: Give the subject a **narrative action** (e.g., "whispering into a phone," "lighting a candle," "looking back in fear").

- **Technical**: Specify "Razor-sharp focus" for the subject inside the gap.



### 4. Atmospheric Lighting

Use lighting to guide the eye through the tunnel.

- **Patterns**: High contrast, light rays (Tyndall effect) piercing through the gap, or low-key lighting for suspense.



## Prompt Construction Template



> **Core Style:** Keyhole reveal composition, gap focus.

> **Foreground:** [Obstruction detail] blocking 50% of the view, heavily out of focus, framing the scene.

> **Subject:** Through a narrow [gap type], [Subject] is visible performing [Action]. 

> **Optics:** Sharp focus on [Subject's detail], deep depth of field, cinematic bokeh.

> **Mood:** [Lighting effect], [Atmosphere keywords], 8k resolution, cinematic color grading.



## Review Checklist



Follow this checklist to ensure prompt quality [4]:

1. **Gap Constraint**: Is the gap narrow enough to create "Tunnel Vision"?

2. **Subject Placement**: Is the subject forced into the center of the gap?

3. **Blur Contrast**: Is the foreground explicitly set to "blurred" and the subject to "sharp"?

4. **Story Element**: Does the scene feel like a "captured secret" rather than just a portrait?
