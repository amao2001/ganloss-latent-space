# High-Dynamic Video Choreographer

This Skill is designed to transform a static concept or image into a professional 5-second video prompt sequence . It focuses on creating large-scale, high-impact movements that follow the laws of physics and cinematic aesthetics .

## When to Use This Skill
- Use this when you need a structured "Image-to-Video" prompt for tools like Sora, Kling, or Runway.
- Use this to ensure a video sequence has **high dynamic energy** rather than subtle, stagnant movements .

## How to Use This Skill

Follow these steps to generate and refine the action sequence:

### 1. Visual & Momentum Analysis
Deeply analyze the subject's initial posture, center of gravity, and environment . Predict the most logical direction of physical force based on the current "frozen moment."

### 2. Iterative Motion Design (Drafting)
Draft **5 distinct Action Beats** (0 to 5 seconds). 
- **Continuity**: Ensure each beat flows logically into the next based on momentum .
- **Scale**: Prioritize large-scale body movements (e.g., sprinting, jumping, diving, sliding) over subtle gestures.

### 3. Recursive Quality Review (Optimization)
Before finalizing the output, you must review the sequence against this checklist to improve quality:
1. **Physical Logic**: Does Beat 3 naturally follow the momentum of Beat 2? (e.g., a high jump must be preceded by a crouch and followed by an impact or roll) .
2. **Visual Diversity**: Are there distinct transitions between different types of motion? (Avoid repetitive movements).
3. **Dynamic Intensity**: Are the movements "high-energy"? Replace any weak actions (like waving or smiling) with high-stakes physical interactions .
4. **Cinematic Flow**: Does the camera work enhance the feeling of speed or power? .

### 4. Final Formatting
Output the result using the following structure, ensuring all technical specifications are included .

## Output Template

**[Subject Description & Context]**

**Beat 1 (0-1.5s)**: [Initial reaction or preparation based on the starting state]
**Beat 2 (1.5-2.0s)**: [Significant shift in posture or beginning of acceleration]
**Beat 3 (2.0-3.0s)**: [Core dynamic peak - the most intense movement]
**Beat 4 (3.0-4.0s)**: [Action climax or dramatic interaction with the environment]
**Beat 5 (4.0-5.0s)**: [Momentum release, inertia, or landing result]

**Camera work**: [Dynamic motion description, e.g., tracking shots, low-angle hero shots].
**Acting style**: Acting should be emotional and realistic [7].

**Technical Specs**: 4K details, natural color, cinematic lighting and shadows, crisp textures, clean edges, fine material detail, high microcontrast, realistic shading, accurate tone mapping, smooth gradients, realistic highlights, detailed fabric and hair, sharp and natural [7].
