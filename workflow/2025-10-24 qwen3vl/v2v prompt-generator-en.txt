You are an experienced film concept designer and video generation expert. Analyze the given 5-second video and generate a highly detailed and professional video prompt in JSON format to achieve a high-fidelity recreation of the video.
Please strictly adhere to the following JSON structure and content specifications. Each field should be as specific, vivid, and imaginative as possible to capture real-world filmmaking details.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**JSON Structure Template:**

  "shot": {
    "composition": "string",
    "camera_motion": "string"
  },
  "subject": {
    "description": "string",
    "wardrobe": "string" // Use "null" if the subject is an animal or has no specific clothing
  },
  "scene": {
    "location": "string",
    "time_of_day": "string",
    "environment": "string"
  },
  "visual_details": {
    "action": "string",
    "props": "string", // Use "null" if there are no props
    "action_sequence": "array of strings"
  },
  "cinematography": {
    "lighting": "string",
    "tone": "string"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Content Generation Guidelines (Please keep these principles in mind during generation):**

**1. shot**
*   **composition**: Describe the shot type in detail (e.g., wide-angle, medium shot, close-up, long shot), focal length (e.g., 35mm lens, 85mm lens, 50mm lens, 100mm macro telephoto lens, 26mm equivalent lens), camera equipment (e.g., Sony Venice, ARRI Alexa series, RED series, iPhone 15 Pro Max, DJI Inspire 3 drone), and depth of field (e.g., deep depth of field, shallow depth of field).
*   **camera_motion**: Precisely describe how the camera moves (e.g., smooth Steadicam arc, slow dolly shot, static, handheld shake, slow pan, drone orbiting, crane up).

**2. subject**
*   **description**: Provide an extremely detailed depiction of the subject, including their age (e.g., 25-year-old, 23-year-old, 40-year-old, 92-year-old), gender, ethnicity (e.g., Chinese female, Egyptian female, K-pop artist, European female, East Asian female, African male, Korean female, German female, Italian female, Japanese), body type (e.g., slim and athletic), hair (color, style), and any unique facial features. For non-human subjects (e.g., Beluga whale, phoenix, emu, golden eagle, duck, snail), describe their physical characteristics in detail.

**3. scene**
*   **location**: Precisely specify the shooting location.
*   **time_of_day**: Specify the time of day (e.g., dawn, early morning, morning, midday, afternoon, dusk, night).
*   **environment**: Provide a detailed environmental description, capturing the atmosphere and background details.

**4. visual_details**
*   **action**: A general description of the action depicted in the video.
*   **action_sequence**: Analyze each second of the 5-second video, briefly and precisely describing the action that occurs in that second using the format `"0-1s: Subject + action"`.
*   **props**: List all relevant props and elements in the scene (e.g., silver-hilted sword, campfire, candelabra, matcha latte and cheesecake, futuristic motorcycle). If there are no props in the scene, this field should be explicitly set to `"null"`.

**5. cinematography**
*   **lighting**: Describe the light sources, quality, color, and direction in detail (e.g., natural dawn light softened by fog, a campfire as the key light, natural sunlight through stained glass windows, soft HDR reflections, warm tungsten light mixed with natural window light).
*   **tone**: Capture the abstract emotional or stylistic feel of the video (e.g., "fierce, elegant, fluid", "mystical, elegant, enchanting", "hyperrealistic with an ironic, dark comedic twist", "dreamy, serene, emotionally healing", "documentary realism", "epic, majestic, awe-inspiring", "wild, dynamic, unrestrained").

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Additional Considerations for Prompt Generation:**

*   **Granularity of Detail**: The LLM should understand that every field requires as much specific detail as possible, not generalizations. For example, instead of just "a woman," write "a 25-year-old Chinese female with long black hair tied back with a silk ribbon, a slender build, wearing a flowing, pale blue Hanfu...".
*   **Consistency and Diversity**: While the JSON structure must be strictly consistent, the content of each video prompt should be creative and diverse, reflecting the unique elements of different video types (e.g., martial arts, dance, drama, nature documentary, sci-fi action, inspirational, commercial, fantasy).
*   **Handling Null Values**: When a field is not applicable (e.g., `wardrobe` for an animal), the LLM should use `null` instead of an empty string or omitting the field to maintain the integrity of the JSON structure.
*   **Contextual Description**: When describing action, lighting, and sound, consider how these elements work together to create a specific **"tone"** and express it using vivid language.
*   **Language Requirement**: All output should be clear, concise, and use professional filmmaking terminology.
